For now there are 2 banners, the Project Analysis Banner and the Risk Analysis Banner, but more are coming in future releases "},{"title":"Project Analysis Banner​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Portfolio Page","url":"/docs/aegis-analytics/portfolio-page/#project-analysis-banner","content":"This is the default active banner that can be identified based on all widgets in the banner having the Aegis blue background color for their headers. By taking a look at this banner, you can identify quickly an overview of how all projects in your portfolio are tracking, both by their progress and their health. By interacting with the individual cards, you can quickly fine tune the Projects Table to see these metrics for a more specific subset of your projects. Here is a rundown of the widgets that make up the Project Analysis Banner: Projects Summary​ The Projects Summary widget is meant to quickly let you know how many active projects you have, and how many of those active projects are missing an update. We are rather generous with our definition of missing an update, where a project will only be marked as such if the data date of the latest upload is 45+ calendar days old, so this can be taken a sign to upload a newer update to a project if one exists. tip You can always check which schedule files you have uploaded to a project, along with relevant dates, in the Schedules Tab on a project's detail page. These 2 widgets can also be clicked to apply a quick filter to the Projects Table. Example If you click the &quot;Missing Updates&quot; card, the card's background color will change from white to another color (in this case orange) to let you know this quick filter is active. The Projects Table will then have a temporary filter applied on it that sets the Project Type to Active and the Update Status to Missing. This then adjusts the projects showing in the Projects Table to be a subset of the ones it was previously showing that are missing and active. To go back to how the list was before, simply click on the &quot;Missing Updates&quot; card once more to remove the quick filter. Projects Breakdown​ This widget is a quick summary of the projects based on their update variance. These individual cards can also be clicked on to apply a quick filter. The pie chart on the right graphs these 3 numbers as percentages for easy comparison. Portfolio Summary​ The Portfolio Summary component takes the Project Score, Progress Score, QC Score, and Predictability Score for the latest update of every project currently showing in the Projects Table and averages them out per score. These scores are then also plotted for the last 6 months on a chart on the right, with the Project Score being selected by default. CLicking a different score's card will toggle the chart on the right. "},{"title":"Risk Analysis Banner​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Portfolio Page","url":"/docs/aegis-analytics/portfolio-page/#risk-analysis-banner","content":"The Risk Analysis Banner has a focus on projects that have risk metrics type 'Monte Carlo - Performance Factor' and 'Monte Carlo - Risk Register'. To view risk analytics, click the red Risk Analytics Button in the Header Metrics section of the Portfolio Page. This will switch the Header Metrics over to Risk View and will filter your projects to only those that have Risk Metrics enabled. Any time a banner is changed, the filters all get reset to the default for that banner. Here is a breakdown of the widgets inside this banner: Risk Summary​ This section is identical to the Projects Summary section on the Project Analysis Banner, except these metrics are for risk enabled projects and there is an additional card for Projects that slipped last period (similar to the Slipped from the Project Analysis' Projects Breakdown). Portfolio Risk​ The Portfolio Risk component is similar to the Project Analysis' Portfolio Summary but in this case we only show the Predictability Score. Categories of Risk​ A new section, Categories of Risk charts three fields that are filled out in the form when creating risks in a risk register: the category of risk, the owner of the risk, and the status of the risk. These are combined across all risk enabled projects and plotted as percentages on the bar or donut charts for quick comparisons. Heat Map​ The Heat Map charts each risk from each project's risk register (from projects that use risk registers) based on its likelihood to occur and the impact that risk will have. There is a third dimension on this chart as well that counts the number of risks with the same likelihood/impact coordinate and makes the bubble larger when there are more risks with that coordinate (the total risks at that coordinate can be viewed by hovering over a bubble). "},{"title":"Projects Table​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Portfolio Page","url":"/docs/aegis-analytics/portfolio-page/#projects-table","content":"The Projects Table lists all projects that you have uploaded to Aegis Analytics, or all projects that you have the permissions to view within your company's hierarchy. Projects in the Project Table can be opened using the blue right caret at the end of each row, which will bring you to the project's details page. To see a brief summary of the project, click anywhere else in the row to bring up the overview. Projects with a yellow triangle in the top left of their row indicate that they are currently missing the most recent update. This can be quick filtered for by clicking &quot;Missing Update&quot; in the Project Summary Header Metrics. To see a more focused subset of projects in this list, utilize the Filter Menu, the searchbar, or one of the Quick Filters in the header banner. This table can be sorted by clicking on a column's header tip If the 'Reset Filters' button is bright red (and not greyed out), that means there currently is a (or combination of) filter(s) applied to the Projects Table. If the project you are looking for is not showing up, simply press the 'Reset Filters' button to get the view back to default. You can then search for the project if you know its name, look for it on the map, or simply scroll down in the Projects Table until you find it. If it still isn't showing up, try including archived projects in the Project Type filter. To maximize the width of the Projects Table and hide the map, press the 'Maximize' button in the top right corner of the Projects Table component. This can be toggled back to the original view by pressing the button again. To export the current list of projects to excel, simply press the 'Export Report' button located just to the left of the maximize button "},{"title":"Filter Menu​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Portfolio Page","url":"/docs/aegis-analytics/portfolio-page/#filter-menu","content":"The filter menu allows you to set a new baseline filter set for the Projects Table. This can be used in combination with Quick Filters and the searchbar to quickly see only the projects you want to see. To see the filter menu, simply click the 'Filters' bar located between the searchbar and list of projects in the Projects Table. To close the filter menu, press the same bar, which is now labeled 'Collapse Filters'. The filters are broken down into 3 sections based on the type of filter they are: Project, Status, or KPI. The Project Filters are basic information filters, all of which were fields you filled out in the New Project Form. For Saas users, the client filter will display only the clients that have been tagged to a project and the company filter will display only the companies you have access to in your company's hierarchy. The default filter set has 'Archived' unchecked in the Project Type filter and if the banner is set to Risk Analysis then 'default' is unchecked from the Risk Metrics Type filter. The Status Filters have a few different options on ways to view project statuses: The current status of the project, a comparison of the current update to the previous update to see if a project is improving or starting to fall behind, a more exact look at how behind your behind projects are compared to the baseline, and whether the latest update in Analytics for your project is current or old. note The Baseline Δ slider strictly compares current and baseline completion dates. In situations such as a covid delay pushing a previously on time or ahead project's completion x months, that project could show up in the negatives. This kind of situation is usually documented in the notes for the first impacted update, which can be viewed in the Schedules Tab of a project's detail page. KPI Filters are ways to quickly filter for projects that are at or below thresholds for each fo the 4 scores we track in Aegis Analytics. You can click and drag to change the value to specific number or tap your left/right arrow keys when the slider is selected (or click the arrows next to the slider) to increment/decrement the value by 1 tick. If the slider value is anything other than the default 0-100, a chip will appear next to the label for the slider to indicate what range is currently being filtered for. Click the x on the chip to reset this filter back to 0-100. The header metrics/charts are all updated as you update the current filter set to reflect the change in projects in the Projects Table. These changes can also be viewed in the summary on the filter bar to the right where it says 'x out of y projects shown'. X is the current amount of projects in the list based on the filters applied and y is the total projects that you have access to. Quick Filter​ While the filter menu and searchbar create a new semi-permanent baseline set of filters (permanent until manually changed or reset), quick filters are temporary filters that are applied on top of the baseline set. These can be useful for quickly toggling between multiple views or for back and forth comparison without the need to open multiple tabs or windows. As an example scenario, lets say you are on the default banner and your team has just finished uploading the latest updates for their projects to Analytics. You can set the baseline filter set through the Filter Menu to make sure the Projects Table only shows projects for this team (in case you have access to other projects). Then you can use the quick filters in the header banner to quickly check if your team missed one (by clicking missing) or check which of these projects has slipped in the last period so you know which ones to pay special attention to this month, or even to see which have improved so that you can pat your team member on the back for getting the project closer to on track.
