"},{"title":"New Project Form​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Navbar","url":"/docs/aegis-analytics/navbar#new-project-form","content":"The New Project Form is the one-stop-shop to input all the necessary information we need to create a Project Page for your projects. There are other spots within the Project Page to add additional flair such as a Project Image or add more details such as risks to a Risk Register, but this form is meant to give you a streamlined experience to get a project added to Aegis Analytics. Here is a rundown of the steps in the New Project Form: Details​ The details step is where you can add a majority of the high-level information about your project such as the project name and which baseline xer schedule file to use. All the fields on this page are important and mandatory to fill out, but make sure to pay special attention to the Company, Point of Contact, and Client fields. These 3 fields are the driving forces behind access to that project. Additional viewing access to that project can be fine-tuned in the Rhino.works Account Settings page. tip If you don't see the client you are looking for in the Client dropdown, you can create a new one by typing out its name in the Client searchbar. Start / Finish​ This step is where the Start Milestone and Finish milestone can be selected. We did our best to put activities tagged as start/finish milestones near the top, but all activities are listed in case you have a better one to use, so use that searchbar to find the appropriate activity and select it! Milestones / Risk​ This optional area allows you to configure up to 5 additional milestones to track and edit the calculation method for risk in your project. Global Impacts can also be adjusted if you choose to use either of the Monte Carlo methods for risk calculations. Notes​ The Notes step is another optional step where you can add Critical Path Summary and Impacts/Issues/TIA notes to the baseline schedule for this project. These can be added later / edited at any time in the Schedules Tab via the pencil icon or the backside of the update's report. Submit​ This section highlights a few key areas of the form for your review before you press submit. Feel free to go back to previous steps to edit information until you are content with the review. Upon pressing the submit button, a novel Project Page will be generated, utilizing the data provided in this form. Subsequently, you will be automatically redirected to the newly created page.

Project Settings​ This window is where you can edit project-related fields after the project has been created. This section is hidden from Project viewers. Here is a rundown of the tabs in this window: Details Tab​ This section has the same fields as the New Project Form's Detail Tab which you can edit. In addition, the start/finish milestones are displayed and a feature unique to this window is updating the Project Type. Projects are automatically tagged as &quot;Baseline&quot; after project creation, and automatically switch to &quot;Active&quot; once the first update is uploaded. You can override this default to whichever project type you need. Scores Tab​ This tab displays the 4 main scores we use - Project, Progress, QC, and Predictability - as well as a breakdown of the components that comprise them. Risk Tab​ The Risk tab allows you to edit the risk calculation metrics type, similar to the Milestones / Risk step on the New Project Form. In addition, there are settings for the Risk Fields. This treelist allows you to add/edit/delete custom options that show up in the fields on the Risk Register Form. Some example uses of this section include adding a bunch of field options before you add risks to this project's Risk Register or edit/delete a misspelled field. The Risk Fields section is only enabled for &quot;Monte Carlo - Risk Register&quot; risk calculation method projects. Admin Tab​ This tab allows you to: edit the Project Files linkarchive the projectrebase your project (coming soon) danger Archiving a project will remove the project from the database. Administrator account is needed to unarchive the project. Project Files​ This button opens up the project files link that was specified in the New Project Form in a new tab. This link can be edited in the Admin Tab of the Project Settings window Add Update (XER)​ Use this button to open the bulk update window. This form functions the same as the one on the Schedules Tab except on submit on this form skips the soft-add feature of the Schedules Tab and just adds these updates to this project. Download Summary (PDF)​ Use this button to download an executive level pdf summary of this project. This summary can be a helpful tool for discussing project health with clients. Give it a second to load after you click it. Recalculate Project​ If something seems off, you can manually recalculate the schedules on this project. If things still seem off after 1 recalculation, use the Provide Feedback button to submit a ticket to our team. This button is hidden for Project viewers. note The data displayed on the project page is either read from or calculated from the update xer files provided, so double check that the information that seems off is correct in the xer schedule updates that are uploaded to this project before making a ticket. See the Schedules Tab to learn how to replace/edit schedule files.
