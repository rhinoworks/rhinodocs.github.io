Here is a rundown of the steps in the New Project Form: Details​ The details step is where you can add a majority of the high-level information about your project such as the project name and which baseline xer schedule file to use. All the fields on this page are important and mandatory to fill out, but make sure to pay special attention to the Company, Point of Contact, and Client fields.

We did our best to put activities tagged as start/finish milestones near the top, but all activities are listed in case you have a better one to use, so use that searchbar to find the appropriate activity and select it! Milestones / Risk​ This optional area allows you to configure up to 5 additional milestones to track and edit the calculation method for risk in your project. Global Impacts can also be adjusted if you choose to use either of the Monte Carlo methods for risk calculations. Notes​ The Notes step is another optional step where you can add Critical Path Summary and Impacts/Issues/TIA notes to the baseline schedule for this project.

Projects are automatically tagged as &quot;Baseline&quot; after project creation, and automatically switch to &quot;Active&quot; once the first update is uploaded. You can override this default to whichever project type you need. Scores Tab​ This tab displays the 4 main scores we use - Project, Progress, QC, and Predictability - as well as a breakdown of the components that comprise them. The first column contains the list of components used to compute the scores in Analytics. The columns refer to the different activity types in your schedule.

Activities in the longest path are the most critical activities in a schedule, so the goal of 100% activity completion has been plotted on this trend chart. Generally when the critical activity completion starts to fall behind this value, the entire project starts to fall behind schedule, which is why we place so much importance on these activities. Likewise, Near Critical activities are almost as important as Critical ones, so we placed an 80% target completion for these. If there were no activities planned to complete in an update for a category, there will be a gap in that category's line for that update. This way, no updates are getting 100% completion credit if they didn't plan on completing any activities in that category, and likewise no updates are getting the penalized with a 0% completion mark.

By taking a look at this banner, you can identify quickly an overview of how all projects in your portfolio are tracking, both by their progress and their health. By interacting with the individual cards, you can quickly fine tune the Projects Table to see these metrics for a more specific subset of your projects. Here is a rundown of the widgets that make up the Project Analysis Banner: Projects Summary​ The Projects Summary widget is meant to quickly let you know how many active projects you have, and how many of those active projects are missing an update. We are rather generous with our definition of missing an update, where a project will only be marked as such if the data date of the latest upload is 45+ calendar days old, so this can be taken a sign to upload a newer update to a project if one exists. tip You can always check which schedule files you have uploaded to a project, along with relevant dates, in the Schedules Tab on a project's detail page. These 2 widgets can also be clicked to apply a quick filter to the Projects Table. Example If you click the &quot;Missing Updates&quot; card, the card's background color will change from white to another color (in this case orange) to let you know this quick filter is active. The Projects Table will then have a temporary filter applied on it that sets the Project Type to Active and the Update Status to Missing. This then adjusts the projects showing in the Projects Table to be a subset of the ones it was previously showing that are missing and active. To go back to how the list was before, simply click on the &quot;Missing Updates&quot; card once more to remove the quick filter. Projects Breakdown​ This widget is a quick summary of the projects based on their update variance. These individual cards can also be clicked on to apply a quick filter. The pie chart on the right graphs these 3 numbers as percentages for easy comparison. Portfolio Summary​ The Portfolio Summary component takes the Project Score, Progress Score, QC Score, and Predictability Score for the latest update of every project currently showing in the Projects Table and averages them out per score. These scores are then also plotted for the last 6 months on a chart on the right, with the Project Score being selected by default. CLicking a different score's card will toggle the chart on the right. "},{"title":"Risk Analysis Banner​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Portfolio Page","url":"/docs/aegis-analytics/portfolio-page/#risk-analysis-banner","content":"The Risk Analysis Banner has a focus on projects that have risk metrics type 'Monte Carlo - Performance Factor' and 'Monte Carlo - Risk Register'.

This will switch the Header Metrics over to Risk View and will filter your projects to only those that have Risk Metrics enabled. Any time a banner is changed, the filters all get reset to the default for that banner. Here is a breakdown of the widgets inside this banner: Risk Summary​ This section is identical to the Projects Summary section on the Project Analysis Banner, except these metrics are for risk enabled projects and there is an additional card for Projects that slipped last period (similar to the Slipped from the Project Analysis' Projects Breakdown). Portfolio Risk​ The Portfolio Risk component is similar to the Project Analysis' Portfolio Summary but in this case we only show the Predictability Score. Categories of Risk​ A new section, Categories of Risk charts three fields that are filled out in the form when creating risks in a risk register: the category of risk, the owner of the risk, and the status of the risk. These are combined across all risk enabled projects and plotted as percentages on the bar or donut charts for quick comparisons. Heat Map​ The Heat Map charts each risk from each project's risk register (from projects that use risk registers) based on its likelihood to occur and the impact that risk will have. There is a third dimension on this chart as well that counts the number of risks with the same likelihood/impact coordinate and makes the bubble larger when there are more risks with that coordinate (the total risks at that coordinate can be viewed by hovering over a bubble).

To see a brief summary of the project, click anywhere else in the row to bring up the overview. Projects with a yellow triangle in the top left of their row indicate that they are currently missing the most recent update. This can be quick filtered for by clicking &quot;Missing Update&quot; in the Project Summary Header Metrics. To see a more focused subset of projects in this list, utilize the Filter Menu, the searchbar, or one of the Quick Filters in the header banner. This table can be sorted by clicking on a column's header tip If the 'Reset Filters' button is bright red (and not greyed out), that means there currently is a (or combination of) filter(s) applied to the Projects Table.

This can be used in combination with Quick Filters and the searchbar to quickly see only the projects you want to see. To see the filter menu, simply click the 'Filters' bar located between the searchbar and list of projects in the Projects Table. To close the filter menu, press the same bar, which is now labeled 'Collapse Filters'. The filters are broken down into 3 sections based on the type of filter they are: Project, Status, or KPI. The Project Filters are basic information filters, all of which were fields you filled out in the New Project Form. For Saas users, the client filter will display only the clients that have been tagged to a project and the company filter will display only the companies you have access to in your company's hierarchy. The default filter set has 'Archived' unchecked in the Project Type filter and if the banner is set to Risk Analysis then 'default' is unchecked from the Risk Metrics Type filter. The Status Filters have a few different options on ways to view project statuses: The current status of the project, a comparison of the current update to the previous update to see if a project is improving or starting to fall behind, a more exact look at how behind your behind projects are compared to the baseline, and whether the latest update in Analytics for your project is current or old. note The Baseline Δ slider strictly compares current and baseline completion dates. In situations such as a covid delay pushing a previously on time or ahead project's completion x months, that project could show up in the negatives. This kind of situation is usually documented in the notes for the first impacted update, which can be viewed in the Schedules Tab of a project's detail page. KPI Filters are ways to quickly filter for projects that are at or below thresholds for each fo the 4 scores we track in Aegis Analytics. You can click and drag to change the value to specific number or tap your left/right arrow keys when the slider is selected (or click the arrows next to the slider) to increment/decrement the value by 1 tick. If the slider value is anything other than the default 0-100, a chip will appear next to the label for the slider to indicate what range is currently being filtered for. Click the x on the chip to reset this filter back to 0-100. The header metrics/charts are all updated as you update the current filter set to reflect the change in projects in the Projects Table. These changes can also be viewed in the summary on the filter bar to the right where it says 'x out of y projects shown'. X is the current amount of projects in the list based on the filters applied and y is the total projects that you have access to. Quick Filter​ While the filter menu and searchbar create a new semi-permanent baseline set of filters (permanent until manually changed or reset), quick filters are temporary filters that are applied on top of the baseline set. These can be useful for quickly toggling between multiple views or for back and forth comparison without the need to open multiple tabs or windows. As an example scenario, lets say you are on the default banner and your team has just finished uploading the latest updates for their projects to Analytics. You can set the baseline filter set through the Filter Menu to make sure the Projects Table only shows projects for this team (in case you have access to other projects). Then you can use the quick filters in the header banner to quickly check if your team missed one (by clicking missing) or check which of these projects has slipped in the last period so you know which ones to pay special attention to this month, or even to see which have improved so that you can pat your team member on the back for getting the project closer to on track.

The Performance Factor utilizes as-built performance data to determine the likelihood of finishing on or before the schedule's current completion date. The standard metric used for this is the P85 date, which is the probabilistic date that predicts with an 85% certainty the project will finish on or before this date. You can view more probabilities and dates in the Monte Carlo Simulation as long as your project has enough updates to display data. You can also configure the pf codes on the right to include or exclude certain codes to get an updated Monte Carlo based on information you know about the project. The P85 date comes from the probability line on the Monte Carlo simulation, which can be derived from the hits bars on the same chart. We run 10000 simulations for each Monte Carlo to determine the most accurate p85. The date chosen as the p85 will be highlighted with a blue column in the chart. To the left of the chart you can compare this p85 date with the current completion date of the schedule. If these dates are far apart, you might want to take a further look at other risk factors in your project to see if they are going to play a larger role in shifting dates than you expected initially.

To add a risk to the register, press the 'Add New Risk' button in the header and follow the workflow in the newly opened window. This workflow has many required fields and some optional ones are what determine their eligibility to be seen in the Monte Carlo Simulation. Some dropdown fields allow you to create custom options on the spot. If you want to edit these custom options or create a bunch all at once for this project, go to the Risk Settings tab in the Project Settings window. In the last tab of the Risk Register form, you have the opportunity to tag a risk to specific activities. Utilize the filter system at the top to show only the activities you are interested in, then click in the 'Tag' column to tag this risk to that activity. Likewise, if you want to tag all activities that are currently showing in the grid, press the 'Tag All' button ('Untag All' does the reverse). To untag an activity click the Tag column again. Once you have the whole form filled out (all required fields) the save button will be enabled. Save the risk for it to show up in the Risk Register and, if applicable, in the Monte Carlo Simulation. If you are not finished with the form and would like to save your progress, simply save this risk as a draft. Draft risks will show up in the Risk register with a blue row and will be excluded from all calculations until they are completed. Another option for getting your risks into the Risk Register is to import them. To do this, press the 'Import' button in the header and follow the directions in the import window. danger All imported risks will be marked as draft risks. Make sure to edit and save them to include them in calculations and possibly give them eligibility for Monte Carlo Simulations. You can edit an already created risk (draft or otherwise) by pressing the pencil icon in the Risk Register Actions column. In the same column there are options to create a new risk by duplicating this one (for fast creation of similar risks) or deleting a risk. Can't see enough risks on this page? Click the button in the top right of the component to expand the risk register to a fullscreen view. Since there is more screen real-estate, by default all columns are selected in fullscreen view. Press the button again to return to the default view. The columns that appear in the Risk Register are the same ones from the form (and have similar header groupings to the tabs in the form), but they can be customized for this project by visiting the column selector in the header. You can also apply column level filters or utilize one of our provided quick filters (located in the header) to trim the list of risks temporarily. The current list of risks (including ones on other pages) can be exported to excel at any time by utilizing the 'Export Report' button in the header.

The main content differences are the Monte Carlo Simulation Chart got moved to the right side and now is split into two sections, one for Pre-Mitigation and one for Pos-Mitigation (each section still has bars for hits and a cumulative probability line). This difference allows the project team to easily see the difference their proposed mitigation strategies will make. By checking different combinations of risks and calculating, you can easily determine priorities for risks to focus on in order to complete the project by a target date. Risks with an identified Activity Impact that are tagged to at least one activity in the schedule will be available for selection in the Monte Carlo simulation grid located in the middle of the component. The schedule impact and mitigation impact will only appear for the risks that were checked during the last calculation. note With version 4.0 of Aegis Analytics, we have the fastest speeds yet for our Monte Carlo simulations. If your project still says it is calculating after 5-10 minutes, contact the project team to have it checked out or submit a ticket.
