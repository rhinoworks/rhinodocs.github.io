The Performance Factor utilizes as-built performance data to determine the likelihood of finishing on or before the schedule's current completion date. The standard metric used for this is the P85 date, which is the probabilistic date that predicts with an 85% certainty the project will finish on or before the determined date. You can view more probabilities and dates in the Monte Carlo Simulation as long as your project has 4+ Update schedules uploaded. You can also configure the pf codes on the right to include or exclude certain codes to get an updated p85 output based on the selected activity codes. The P85 date comes from the probability line on the Monte Carlo simulation, which can be derived from the hits bars on the same chart. We run 10000 simulations for each Monte Carlo to determine the most accurate p85. The date chosen as the p85 will be highlighted with a blue column in the chart. To the left of the chart you can compare this p85 date with the current completion date of the schedule.

Project Settings​ This window is where you can edit project-related fields after the project has been created. This section is hidden from Project viewers. Here is a rundown of the tabs in this window: Details Tab​ This section has the same fields as the New Project Form's Detail Tab which you can edit. In addition, the start/finish milestones are displayed and a feature unique to this window is updating the Project Type. Projects are automatically tagged as &quot;Baseline&quot; after project creation, and automatically switch to &quot;Active&quot; once the first update is uploaded. You can override this default to whichever project type you need. Milestones Tab​ This tab allows you to select additional Finish Milestones or Activities that you would like to track in addition to Project Completion (CCD). Scores Tab​ This tab displays the 4 main scores we use - Project, Progress, QC, and Risk - as well as a breakdown of the components that comprise them. The first column contains the list of components used to compute the scores in Analytics. The columns refer to the different activity types in your schedule. Select/de-select your preferred activity types to reflect unique scenarios within your schedules. Blue checkboxes signify the occurrence of that activity type within the category, and grey checkboxes appear when the activity type is not present within that category for the latest schedule. Risk Tab​ The Risk tab allows you to edit the risk calculation metrics type and global impacts, similar to the Milestones / Risk step on the New Project Form. In addition, there are settings for the Risk Fields. This treelist allows you to add/edit/delete custom options that show up in the fields on the Risk Register Form. Some example uses of this section include adding a bunch of field options before you add risks to this project's Risk Register or edit/delete a misspelled field. The Risk Fields section is only enabled for &quot;Monte Carlo - Risk Register&quot; risk calculation method projects. Admin Tab​ This tab allows you to: edit the Project Files link archive the project recalculate the project If something seems off, you can manually recalculate the schedules on this project. If things still seem off after 1 recalculation, use the Contact Us button within the Help Menu to submit a ticket to our team. note The data displayed on the project page is either read from or calculated from the update xer files provided, so double check that the information that seems off is correct in the xer schedule updates that are uploaded to this project before making a ticket. See the Schedules Tab to learn how to replace/edit schedule files. danger Archiving a project will remove the project from the database. Administrator account is needed to unarchive the project. Project Files​ This button opens up the project files link that was specified in the New Project Form in a new tab. This link can be edited in the Admin Tab of the Project Settings window Add Update​ Use this button to open the bulk update window. This form functions the same as the one on the Schedules Tab except submitting on this form skips the soft-add feature of the Schedules Tab and just adds these updates to this project.

By taking a look at this banner, you can identify quickly an overview of how all projects in your portfolio are tracking, both by their progress and their health. By interacting with the individual cards, you can quickly fine tune the Projects Table to see these metrics for a more specific subset of your projects. Here is a rundown of the widgets that make up the Project Analysis Banner: Projects Summary​ The Projects Summary widget is meant to quickly let you know how many active projects you have, and how many of those active projects are missing an update. We are rather generous with our definition of missing an update, where a project will only be marked as such if the data date of the latest upload is 45+ calendar days old, so this can be taken a sign to upload a newer update to a project if one exists. tip You can always check which schedule files you have uploaded to a project, along with relevant dates, in the Schedules Tab on a project's detail page. These 2 widgets can also be clicked to apply a quick filter to the Projects Table. Example If you click the &quot;Missing Updates&quot; card, the card's background color will change from white to another color (in this case orange) to let you know this quick filter is active. The Projects Table will then have a temporary filter applied on it that sets the Project Type to Active and the Update Status to Missing. This then adjusts the projects showing in the Projects Table to be a subset of the ones it was previously showing that are missing and active. To go back to how the list was before, simply click on the &quot;Missing Updates&quot; card once more to remove the quick filter. Projects Breakdown​ This widget is a quick summary of the projects based on their update variance. These individual cards can also be clicked on to apply a quick filter. Portfolio Summary​ The Portfolio Summary component takes the Project Score, Progress Score, QC Score, and Risk Score for the latest update of every project currently showing in the Projects Table and averages them out per score. These scores are then also plotted for the last 6 months on a chart on the right, with the Project Score being selected by default. Clicking a different score's card will toggle the chart on the right. "},{"title":"Cost Analysis Banner​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Portfolio Page","url":"/docs/aegis-analytics/portfolio-page/#cost-analysis-banner","content":" This chart takes the last 6 months (with respect to the latest month from the displayed projects' data dates, inclusive) and compares the baseline planned cost with the actual cost for each project. The periodic data is aggregated in order to consider all projects currently showing in your grid. To get a more direct look at specific projects' cost data, utilize the Filters to view a subset of projects or go to the Cost Tab on an individual project dashboard. Costs Summary​ This section shows the number of cost-loaded projects that are currently active as well as the Current SPI, which is the average of the latest cumulative SPI for all projects showing. You may click the Active Cost-Loaded Projects button to apply a quick filter for the project table. Baseline Historic Performance​ This chart takes the last 6 months (with respect to the latest month from the displayed projects' data dates, inclusive) and compares the baseline planned cost with the actual cost for each project. The data is represented in a cumulative fashion in order to consider all projects currently showing in your grid. To get a more direct look at specific projects' cost data, utilize the Filters to view a subset of projects or go to the Cost Tab of an individual project. Periodic Remaining Costs​ The Periodic Remaining Costs chart is a forward-looking chart that takes the next 6 months (with respect to the month of the latest data date from the displayed projects) and charts the aggregate planned early and late remaining costs for each month. The average is calculated to be halfway between the early and late values. Cumulative Remaining Costs​ This chart takes the monthly data from the Periodic Remaining Costs Chart and aggregates the data in a cumulative fashion. You will notice this chart tends to converge together as you move right, which is because the closer you get to the end of your project, the less variability there will be in costs, as there are fewer tasks left to complete in order to finish the project. "},{"title":"Risk Analysis Banner​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Portfolio Page","url":"/docs/aegis-analytics/portfolio-page/#risk-analysis-banner","content":" The Risk Analysis Banner has a focus on projects that have risk metrics type 'Monte Carlo - Performance Factor' and 'Monte Carlo - Risk Register'. Here is a breakdown of the widgets inside this banner: Risk Summary​ This section is identical to the Projects Summary section on the Project Analysis Banner, except these metrics are for risk enabled projects and there is an additional card for Projects that slipped last period (similar to the Slipped from the Project Analysis' Projects Breakdown). Portfolio Risk​ The Portfolio Risk component is similar to the Project Analysis' Portfolio Summary but in this case we only show the Risk Score. Categories of Risk​ A new section, Categories of Risk charts three fields that are filled out in the form when creating risks in a risk register: the category of risk, the owner of the risk, and the status of the risk. These are combined across all risk enabled projects and plotted as percentages on the bar or as a table for quick comparisons. In addition, we have broken down your top 5 Risks by Status for easy viewing in a grid. Make sure to keep on top of these risks! Heat Map​ The Heat Map charts each risk from each project's risk register (from projects that use risk registers) based on its likelihood to occur and the impact that risk will have. There is a third dimension on this chart as well that counts the number of risks with the same likelihood/impact coordinate and makes the bubble larger when there are more risks with that coordinate (the total risks at that coordinate can be viewed by hovering over a bubble).

"},{"title":"Filters​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Portfolio Page","url":"/docs/aegis-analytics/portfolio-page/#filters","content":" The filter menu allows you to set a new baseline filter set for the Projects Table. This can be used in combination with Quick Filters and the searchbar to quickly see only the projects you want to see. To see the filter menu, simply click the 'Toggle Filter Menu' button to the left of the 'Reset Filters' Button. To close the filter menu, press the same toggle filter button or you may hit the x on the popup window. The filters are broken down into 3 sections based on the type of filter they are: Project, Status, or KPI. The Project Filters are basic information filters, all of which were fields you filled out in the New Project Form. For Saas users, the client filter will display only the clients that have been tagged to a project and the company filter will display only the companies you have access to in your company's hierarchy. The default filter set has 'Archived' unchecked in the Project Type filter and if the banner is set to Risk Analysis then 'default' is unchecked from the Risk Metrics Type filter. Similarly, cost-loaded gets set to 'Yes' when on the Cost Analysis Banner. The Status Filters have a few different options on ways to view project statuses: The current status of the project, a comparison of the current update to the previous update to see if a project is improving or starting to fall behind, a more exact look at how behind your behind projects are compared to the baseline, and whether the latest update in Analytics for your project is current or old. note The Baseline Δ slider strictly compares current and baseline completion dates. In situations such as a covid delay pushing a previously on time or ahead project's completion x months, that project could show up in the negatives. This kind of situation is usually documented in the notes for the first impacted update, which can be viewed in the Schedules Tab of a project's detail page. KPI Filters are ways to quickly filter for projects that are at or below thresholds for each of the 4 scores we track in Aegis Analytics. You can click and drag to change the value to specific number or tap your left/right arrow keys when the slider is selected (or click the arrows next to the slider) to increment/decrement the value by 1 tick. If the slider value is anything other than the default 0-100, a chip will appear next to the label for the slider to indicate what range is currently being filtered for. Click the x on the chip to reset this filter back to 0-100. The header metrics/charts are all updated as you update the current filter set to reflect the change in projects in the Projects Table. Utilizing these filters is a powerful way to narrow down your portfolio to see specific groups of projects. If you find a filter combination you view often, don't forget to create a layout with this filter set so that you can come back to it in the future very easily. Quick Filter​ While the filter menu and searchbar create a new semi-permanent baseline set of filters (permanent until manually changed or reset), quick filters are temporary filters that are applied on top of the baseline set. These can be useful for quickly toggling between multiple views or for back and forth comparison without the need to open multiple tabs or windows. As an example scenario, lets say you are on the default banner and your team has just finished uploading the latest updates for their projects to Analytics. You can set the baseline filter set through the Filter Menu to make sure the Projects Table only shows projects for this team (in case you have access to other projects). Then you can use the quick filters in the header banner to quickly check if your team missed one (by clicking missing) or check which of these projects has slipped in the last period so you know which ones to pay special attention to this month, or even to see which have improved so that you can pat your team member on the back for getting the project closer to on track. tip If the 'Reset Filters' button is bright red (and not greyed out), that means there currently is a (or combination of) filter(s) applied to the Projects Table. If the project you are looking for is not showing up, simply press the 'Reset Filters' button to get the view back to default. You can then search for the project if you know its name, look for it on the map, or simply scroll down in the Projects Table until you find it. If it still isn't showing up, try including archived projects in the Project Type filter. If you still can't find it and are sure it has been added to Analytics, use the Contact Us Form to submit a ticket with our team.
